## Notable Coursework

**Foundations of Ecosystem Restoration** *Restoration Master Plan*

Working with a 4-person group, we created a 30-page proposal for the restoration of Lake Los Carneros, a 94-acre public park in Goleta, California. We assessed the site, analyzed the opportunities and challenges in restoration, proposed restoration actions, and created a budget and timeline to complete the project within 2 years with $500,000. The proposed restoration would restore 20 acres of perennial grassland and reduce soil compaction with the implementation of a controlled burn, grazing, tilling, soil amendments, and native plant seeding.

**Field Studies of California's Coast** *Mapping the Change, Form, and Function of the Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve*

As an individual segment of a larger group project focusing on Carpinteria Salt Marsh UC Natural Reserve (CSMR), I established a baseline understanding of salt marsh processes and function. Referencing historical t-sheets, I analyzed change in salt marsh cover in California from 1850 to the present. I also explored past and current restoration of CSMR, working to frame my partner's geomorphic change detection map depicting the change in elevation before and after the 2018 Montecito Debris Flow following the 2017 Thomas Fire.

**America's Public Lands and Waters: Law and Policy** *Public Testimony*

Working with a classmate, we wrote a 16-page mock testimony to Congress exploring and addressing the issue of overtourism in the National Parks. We then gave oral testimony and addresses questions from professor and peers. We suggested implementing a policy requiring all national parks to consider integrating visitor management plans into their general management plans as a potential solution to the issue of overtourism.

## CERT Training

Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program is a FEMA program which educates volunteers on disaster preparedness. For California, training focuses on preparation for earthquakes and wildfires. In addition to disaster awareness and preparedness, CERT members are also educated in fire safety, light search and rescue, disaster medical operations and triage protocols, and team organization. I obtained my CERT training through UCSB's CERT club, in collaboration with the Campus Emergency Manager and Santa Barbara County Fire Station #17, over the course of three days.
