        "Hi! I'm Aidan - a third year undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara double majoring in environmental studies and geography. I'm really interested in controlled burns as a tool for restoration, and am looking forward to engaging in some research on UCSB's own Lagoon Island this summer! I work at the front desk for the Student Resource Building on campus where I get to work with an awesome student staff team and help students find the resources they need. I love watching movies with my friends, baking, obsessing over my Google Calendar, and a good spreadsheet!\n",
