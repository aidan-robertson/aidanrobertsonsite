## about me!

Hi! I'm Aidan - an undergraduate student at UC Santa Barbara double majoring in environmental studies and geography. I'm really interested in controlled burns as a tool for restoration, and am looking forward to engaging in some research on UCSB's own Lagoon Island this summer! I love watching movies with my friends, baking, and Google Calendar.
